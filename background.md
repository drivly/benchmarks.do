Benchmarking LLMs for Business Use Cases: Task Categories and Dataset Priorities

Introduction

Evaluating Large Language Models on business-centric tasks requires benchmarks that mirror real enterprise workflows rather than academic puzzles. Traditional NLP benchmarks focus on generic knowledge or trivia and often fail to reflect specific business processes ￼ ￼. For example, a model might ace a science quiz but struggle to parse an invoice or decide a loan outcome – tasks vital for businesses. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark suite covering both horizontal business functions (HR, Legal, Finance, Marketing, Operations) and key industry verticals (Automotive, Retail, Manufacturing, Insurance, Financial Services). All tasks are deterministic, objectively measurable evaluations (structured outputs with clear ground truth), focusing on practical enterprise use-cases rather than open-ended generation.

Scope and Inputs: The benchmark spans tasks like document information extraction, process decision classification, straightforward text classification, and agentic tool use. Inputs will range from unstructured text (e.g. emails, reports), documents (simulated PDFs or OCR text from images), to structured JSON snippets. All model outputs are in JSON – ensuring consistency and easy automatic scoring ￼. By constraining tasks to have objective answers, we can reliably quantify performance. We emphasize realistic business scenarios (e.g. loan underwriting, insurance claim handling, invoice processing) over academic QA or trivia, avoiding overlap with benchmarks like MMLU or BIG-Bench.

Design Criteria: In designing this suite, we prioritize tasks that (1) can be quickly populated with realistic synthetic data, (2) offer broad coverage across functions and industries, and (3) could later be expanded with anonymized real-world data. The goal is a minimal yet comprehensive set of evaluations that can be built in days, then enriched over time. Below, we outline the categories of evaluation tasks with examples and data sources, followed by a prioritization ranking and a mapping of tasks to business domains.

Evaluation Task Categories and Examples

1. Information Extraction from Unstructured Documents

Many business workflows require extracting structured information from free-form documents. LLMs should be tested on their ability to act like a data extractor or “virtual OCR”, pulling specific fields from text or scanned documents and outputting them in JSON format ￼. This category covers use-cases in finance, procurement, HR, and insurance where key data must be mined from forms, contracts, or reports. It directly evaluates an LLM’s precision and recall in identifying facts in messy inputs.

Example Evaluation Tasks (Extraction):
	•	Invoice and Receipt Data Extraction – Function: Finance/Ops; Verticals: Retail, Manufacturing, Automotive (supply chain). The model is given an invoice (simulated PDF text or OCR output) and must return a JSON with fields like vendor name, invoice date, line items (item, quantity, price), tax, and total. Data: We can generate synthetic invoices by templating common invoice formats (varying layouts, terms, and currencies) and populating with random realistic values. For example, an invoice text might list a supplier, invoice #, dates and itemized charges, which the model should map to a JSON schema. This task is highly feasible to simulate (invoices follow semi-structured patterns) and very useful across industries (accounts payable processing) ￼ ￼. Existing resources: Invoice-NER datasets on Kaggle or the SROIE receipt dataset can provide ground-truth examples of fields to extract.
	•	Resume Parsing (Candidate Profile Extraction) – Function: HR; Verticals: All (recruiting is horizontal). Input is a job applicant’s resume (unstructured text or PDF) and the model outputs a JSON with standardized fields: name, contact info, education, work experience (companies and durations), skills, etc. Data: Synthetic resumes can be generated by creating a library of dummy names, universities, job titles, and assembling them into varied resume formats. We could also leverage publicly available anonymized resumes or use LLMs to produce realistic resume texts. This tests the model’s ability to handle semi-structured text and map it to a structured profile. It’s useful for HR automation (screening and database entry) and synthetic generation is moderate in difficulty (resumes have many formats, but common sections make templating feasible).
	•	Contract Clause Extraction – Function: Legal/Compliance; Verticals: Financial Services, Manufacturing. Given a snippet of a contract or agreement, the model must extract specific clauses or data points (e.g. “Payment Terms”, “Effective Date”, “Party Names”, “Termination Clause”) into JSON fields. Data: Creating fully realistic legal documents from scratch is complex, but we can start with boilerplate contract templates (e.g. NDA, service agreements) and perturb names, dates, and amounts. Alternatively, use a smaller set of real contracts (anonymized) if available. This task evaluates comprehension of complex language and is valuable for legal review automation. However, due to the difficulty of generating authentic legal language, this may be a lower priority initially, to possibly expand later when real contract data can be obtained.
	•	Insurance Claim Form Extraction – Function: Operations/Risk; Vertical: Insurance (and Automotive for auto claims). The model receives an insurance claim document or description (could be a filled-out form or an adjuster’s notes) and must output structured data: policy ID, claimant name, incident date/location, claim type, claimed amount, etc. Data: We can simulate claim descriptions (e.g. “Claimant John Doe reports a car accident on 2025-01-10… damage to rear bumper… estimated cost $2,000”) and have known values to extract. There are known datasets of insurance claims, e.g. a public set of 190k claim descriptions labeled by category ￼, which can inform the fields and vocabulary. This task is highly relevant to insurance workflows (claim intake automation) and synthetic narratives can be generated fairly quickly. It ensures the benchmark covers the insurance vertical directly.

Why Extraction Matters: These tasks check if an LLM can precisely identify information in unstructured inputs and format it correctly. Success is measured by field-level accuracy (e.g., exact string match or numeric tolerance for extracted values). By covering documents like invoices (common to finance and procurement), resumes (HR), contracts (legal) and claims (insurance), we ensure broad horizontal and vertical coverage in this category.

2. Context-Aware Next-Step Decision Classification

In many business processes, after reading a scenario, an employee must decide “what to do next.” This category evaluates LLMs on understanding context and choosing the correct next action or classification for a given state. It’s essentially a contextual classification: given a history or current status, predict the next step or decision label. This reflects real workflows in operations, customer service, and finance where context dictates actions (for example, in a loan process or a support ticket escalation). The output is typically a JSON with a predefined decision or next-step label.

Example Evaluation Tasks (Next-Step Decisions):
	•	Workflow Activity Recommendation – Function: Operations/Process; Verticals: Manufacturing, BPM in any industry. The model is given a sequence of completed steps in a business process and must predict the next activity. For instance, in a manufacturing quality control process: steps completed might be “Inspection -> Defect Identified -> Part isolated”, next step could be “Initiate Rework” vs “Scrap Material”. This is analogous to the BPM “activity recommendation” task described in research ￼ – testing if the LLM understands logical process flow. Data: We can use simple process templates (e.g., order fulfillment, employee onboarding, incident management) and create partial sequences, asking the model to pick the correct next step from the process definition. Synthetic generation is feasible by enumerating process maps and withholding the next step. This evaluates sequence understanding and is applicable in operations and workflow automation (including RPA contexts).
	•	Loan Application Underwriting Decision – Function: Finance/Risk; Vertical: Financial Services. Input is a loan application scenario – e.g., a JSON or text summary of an applicant’s financial info and the current underwriting stage (credit score, income, loan amount, any flags). The model must output a decision or next action in JSON, such as { "decision": "Approve" } or "Refer to Manual Review" or "Request Additional Documents". Data: We can generate synthetic applicant profiles (vary credit scores, incomes, debt ratios) and apply simple lending rules to label each (e.g., if credit < 600 -> reject; if high debt-income -> manual review; else approve). The model’s job is to emulate those rules. This task is moderately easy to simulate and extremely useful – it mirrors credit underwriting processes in banks. It provides coverage for the financial services vertical beyond simple classification by requiring reasoning on multiple fields in context.
	•	Insurance Claim Triage – Function: Operations/Claims; Vertical: Insurance. The model is given an insurance claim scenario (could be a text summary of an incident and policy details) and must decide the next step: e.g., categorize the claim’s route: "approve_pay_out", "send_for_further_investigation", or "request_additional_info". Data: Synthetic scenarios can be created by outlining different claim complexities (straightforward small claim vs large suspicious claim vs incomplete info). For example, if a claim mentions minor damage below a threshold, next step = auto-approve; if keywords like “injury, lawsuit” appear, next step = escalate to investigation. This tests context understanding similar to the loan task but in insurance domain. It’s feasible to generate and demonstrates vertical coverage (insurance claims workflow).
	•	Order Fulfillment Next Action – Function: Operations/Supply Chain; Verticals: Retail, Manufacturing. Given the current state of a customer order, the model decides the next action in fulfillment. For instance, input could detail an order with certain items, inventory levels, and shipping status (e.g., “Item A in stock, Item B on backorder, customer priority high”). The model would output a decision like "action": "Ship available items and backorder B" vs "await inventory for complete shipment". Data: We can simulate order data with various conditions (partial stock, delays, etc.) and encode business rules (ship partial if delay > X days, otherwise wait, etc.). The model must learn these patterns. This is useful for operations in retail/manufacturing (inventory management decisions). Synthetic data generation is straightforward by enumerating combinations of order conditions and outcomes.
	•	Support Ticket Escalation – Function: Customer Support/IT; Verticals: All (common IT helpdesk process). Input is the history of a support ticket (conversation summary or issue details + time elapsed). The model outputs the next handling step: e.g., "resolve_at_tier1", "escalate_to_tier2", "schedule_callback". Data: We can script simple helpdesk scenarios (if issue not solved in 2 replies -> escalate, if user is unhappy -> escalate, if solved -> close). This tests an LLM’s ability to follow support protocols given context. It’s relatively easy to generate and widely applicable (internal IT support, customer service centers, etc.).

Why Contextual Decision Tasks: These evaluations measure dynamic reasoning – the LLM must interpret context and apply business rules to choose the correct outcome. They simulate real decision points in workflows (loan approval, claim handling, order shipping, ticket escalation) where consistency and accuracy are critical. Performance can be measured by accuracy against the known correct next step for each scenario. By including these tasks, the benchmark goes beyond static QA, testing process understanding and decision-making capabilities of LLMs in business settings ￼.

3. Structured Text Classification Tasks

This category includes classic classification problems on business text – but focused on practical enterprise needs like routing, tagging, and analyzing communications. Here, the input is typically a single text (or a set of fields) and the output is a structured category label or flags in JSON. These tasks are generally easier to synthetic generate and verify, and they appear across all horizontal functions (from triaging emails to analyzing customer sentiments). They ensure we cover the simpler yet high-value use-cases where an LLM replaces a rule-based classifier.

Example Evaluation Tasks (Classification):
	•	Support Ticket Categorization & Priority – Function: Operations/IT Support; Verticals: Tech, Retail, etc. The model reads a customer support ticket (subject + description) and classifies it into a department/category and an urgency level. For example, an email like “Our point-of-sale system is down, need urgent help” should yield something like: { "department": "IT", "category": "Software Issue", "priority": "High" }. Data: We can leverage existing labeled ticket datasets – e.g., an IT helpdesk dataset that labels tickets by Software vs Hardware vs Accounting issues and priority ￼. Tobias Bück’s Email Ticket Classification data provides such labels (Software/Hardware/Accounting categories and Low/Med/High priority) ￼. We can also create synthetic tickets by taking common support issues and tagging them. This task is highly feasible (many public examples, straightforward labels) and broadly useful: every enterprise deals with support inquiries and could use automated triage.
	•	Customer Feedback Sentiment & Topic Analysis – Function: Marketing/Customer Experience; Verticals: Retail, Automotive, Services. Input is a piece of customer feedback – e.g., a product review or a survey response – and the model outputs sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and possibly a categorized topic of the feedback. For instance: “The delivery was late and the package was damaged” could map to { "sentiment": "Negative", "issue_type": "Shipping" }. Data: We can take existing review datasets (from retail products or automotive customer surveys) and label them by sentiment and a set of common topics (price, quality, support, etc.), or generate synthetic reviews with known sentiment cues. Sentiment classification is a well-studied NLP task, but here we tailor it to business needs by also extracting the key issue category. This is useful for automated customer sentiment analysis and is easily expandable with real data (companies have tons of review/comment data).
	•	Email Intent Classification (Routing) – Function: Operations/General; Verticals: All. Businesses receive many emails or messages that need routing to the right team. In this task, the model reads an incoming email (for example, a general inbox or contact form message) and classifies its intent/dept, outputting a label like "HR_query", "IT_support", "Sales_lead", etc. Data: Synthetic generation is easy: one can script prototypical emails (e.g., an employee asking about vacation policy -> HR, a client asking for a price quote -> Sales, a customer reporting an outage -> Support). Alternatively, if any public Enron-like email dataset is available with categories, it could be used. This evaluation checks that the LLM can catch keywords and context to correctly route requests. It’s a simple classification but very practical for workflow automation (email triage).
	•	Fraudulent Transaction Description Detection – Function: Finance/Security; Vertical: Financial Services. In finance, certain free-text fields like transaction memos or insurance claim notes might hint at fraud. For a twist, we include a task where the model classifies a short textual transaction description or claim note as "potential_fraud" or "normal". Data: Create synthetic bank transaction logs or claim notes, where some contain red-flag phrases (e.g., “quick refund transfer”, “urgent payout abroad”) and mark those as fraud. This tests the model’s classification on short texts with subtle cues. It’s objectively measurable (we decide which are fraud in the data generation). While real fraud patterns are complex, this synthetic task covers the financial compliance angle in our benchmark.
	•	Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Task Identification – Function: Operations/Automation; Verticals: All. This task is inspired by process improvement: given a text description of a business task or procedure, the model classifies whether it’s a good candidate for automation (RPA) or not. For example, an input might be “Employee copies data from email orders into the CRM system daily” -> output "automation_candidate": true. Another: “Manager negotiates contract terms with vendor” -> "automation_candidate": false (needs human judgment). Data: Use a list of common office tasks, label those that are rule-based/repetitive as automatable and others as requiring human skill. In fact, a recent study used LLMs to identify RPA opportunities in process descriptions ￼. This task is straightforward to simulate and valuable for operations optimization. It evaluates the model’s understanding of task descriptions and ability to categorize by abstract criteria (manual vs automate).

Why Classification Tasks: These tasks ensure the benchmark covers the “bread-and-butter” uses of NLP in enterprises: routing tickets, analyzing feedback, flagging items. They are typically single-turn predictions with clearly defined labels, making evaluation simple (accuracy/F1). We avoid academic trivia and use domain content (IT tickets, customer reviews, financial notes) so the LLM’s domain adaptation is tested. Also, synthetic data for these is relatively quick to generate, addressing our feasibility goal. Many real datasets exist or can be open-sourced later (as with support tickets and claim data) ￼ ￼.

4. Agentic Tool Use within Business Workflows

A frontier for LLMs in business is acting as an agent: deciding to call external tools or APIs to fulfill a user request. In enterprise settings, an LLM might need to fetch data, update a record, or perform a transaction by interfacing with software tools. This category evaluates an LLM’s ability to produce the correct sequence of tool calls or actions (in structured JSON) given an instruction – essentially testing tool-use planning and integration. All outputs here are structured as action JSON (e.g., specifying which API to call and with what parameters). We check if the model chooses the right tool and produces the right call, which is objectively verifiable.

Example Evaluation Tasks (Agentic Tool-Use):
	•	Calendar Scheduling Request – Function: Operations/Executive Assistant; Verticals: All. The model receives a natural language request like “Schedule a meeting with the finance team next Wednesday at 10am for 1 hour.” It should output a JSON action for the calendar API, e.g.:

{ 
  "action": "CreateEvent", 
  "calendar": "Team Calendar", 
  "date": "2025-04-23T10:00", 
  "duration": "60", 
  "participants": ["Finance Team"] 
}

Data: We can synthesize meeting requests by varying dates, times, participants, and ensure the expected JSON is known. This task tests parsing of time expressions and intent, and whether the LLM knows to use the scheduling tool. It’s easy to generate (many sample phrases for scheduling) and widely applicable (meeting scheduling is universal).

	•	Database Query and Retrieval – Function: HR/IT Self-Service; Verticals: All. For example: “How many vacation days has Jane Doe taken this year?” or “What’s the status of ticket #12345?”. The model should output a JSON calling the appropriate enterprise database API. For a PTO query: { "action": "QueryHRDatabase", "employee": "Jane Doe", "field": "PTO_used", "year": 2025 }. For a ticket: { "action": "QueryTicketSystem", "ticket_id": "12345" }. Data: Create synthetic Q&A pairs for HR info, IT ticket info, etc., with a defined set of APIs. The correct output is a JSON with the right function and parameters. This evaluates the model’s agentic decision to fetch info rather than answer from knowledge: i.e., recognizing that it should use a tool. We can also include a second step where the API (simulated) returns a result and the model must output a final structured answer – but initial evaluation is just on selecting and formatting the tool call correctly. This is feasible to simulate (just decide some internal APIs and sample queries) and very useful for enterprise assistants that bridge to internal systems.
	•	Financial Data Fetch (API Calling) – Function: Finance; Vertical: Financial Services. A user asks “What’s the current stock price of XYZ Corp?” or “Retrieve the latest exchange rate for EUR to USD.” Instead of answering from training data, the model should produce an API call JSON like { "action": "CallStockAPI", "ticker": "XYZ" } or { "action": "CallFXAPI", "base": "EUR", "target": "USD" }. Data: We define a few finance-related tools (stock quote, FX rate, perhaps a portfolio lookup) and generate queries. The model’s output is checked against the expected tool usage. This tests integration with real-time data systems, a critical capability in finance apps. Synthetic generation is straightforward (many factual questions can be posed).
	•	Computation or Analysis via Tools – Function: Operations/Analytics; Verticals: All (especially Manufacturing, Retail for analytics). E.g., “Calculate the total sales for Q1 from these records” or “Generate a summary of this log file”. The model should output a plan to use a calculator or summary tool. However, since our focus is structured JSON output, a simpler example: “What is the sum of the following numbers: 123, 456, 789?” and the model outputs { "action": "Calculator.add", "inputs": [123,456,789] } -> { "result": 1368 }. This ensures the LLM knows when to delegate math to a tool. Data: Simple arithmetic or data analysis queries with known answers. While trivial, it ensures the agentic capability is covered (important for any vertical where analysis is needed).

Why Tool-Use Tasks: These tasks are unique because they evaluate an interactive skill: the model’s ability to respond in a structured way that triggers external functionality. It’s not just about answering correctly, but doing so via the correct action. In real business applications, LLMs will often function as cognitive automation agents (for example, auto-completing workflows in an ERP system). By benchmarking tool use, we measure readiness for such integrated deployments. Each query has a deterministically “correct” action or API call, so we can score it exact-match. Covering scheduling and database queries hits common horizontal needs (calendaring, HR lookup, IT tickets), and financial API use covers vertical-specific needs. These tasks are quick to simulate and can later be combined with actual API stubs for more realistic evaluation.

Prioritization of Evaluation Tasks

Given limited time to assemble this benchmark (a matter of days), we must prioritize tasks that maximize coverage and feasibility. Below is a ranked list of evaluation tasks/categories to implement first, based on: (1) ease of synthetic data generation, (2) usefulness across multiple business units/industries, and (3) ability to later enrich with real data. Each task is labeled High/Medium/Low priority for initial inclusion:
	1.	Invoice/Receipt Data Extraction – High Priority: This tops the list due to high feasibility (invoices have predictable structures and can be auto-generated) and broad impact. It directly serves Finance/Ops and appears in Retail, Manufacturing, Automotive supply chains, etc. Every company processes invoices ￼, and we can rapidly create synthetic yet realistic invoice texts. Real AP invoice data can be slotted in later, making this both a quick win and a foundation for expansion.
	2.	Support Ticket Classification (Dept & Priority) – High Priority: Classifying support tickets or emails is straightforward to simulate (lots of public examples) and incredibly useful across IT and customer support domains. It covers Operations horizontally and any vertical with a helpdesk. We can leverage existing datasets of labeled tickets ￼ to save time. Synthetic variation (different wording of issues) can augment the data easily. This task ensures the benchmark addresses a daily enterprise scenario (ticket triage) with minimal effort.
	3.	Insurance Claim Triage/Categorization – High Priority: We prioritize an insurance-specific task to cover that vertical, and claim processing is ideal. Synthetic claim descriptions can be created quickly, and an existing large dataset of 190k claims with categories shows such data is available ￼. Implementing a claim classification (by type or next action) provides immediate value to insurance domain evaluation. It’s also extensible: later we could incorporate real (anonymized) claims or even images of claim forms. Given the insurance industry’s focus on AI for claims, this is a timely and feasible inclusion.
	4.	Loan Application Decision (Risk Classification) – Medium-High Priority: This task addresses the financial services vertical and involves multi-field reasoning. It’s slightly more complex to generate synthetic data (needs coherent applicant profiles and rule-based outcomes), hence not top-2, but still quite feasible with simple rules. The use-case (loan underwriting or credit risk classification) is highly useful for banks and lenders. We rank it just below the pure extraction/classification tasks because of the extra step to generate realistic combinations of financial attributes. However, including it early would significantly expand our benchmark’s coverage (finance domain, decision-making logic). We target a basic version now (perhaps just using a few key features and thresholds) and can refine it with real loan datasets later.
	5.	Agentic Tool-Use Tasks (Calendar & DB Query) – Medium Priority: Testing tool use is important to gauge an LLM’s ability to function in an automated workflow. We propose to include at least one simplified agent task early on – for instance, the calendar scheduling or database lookup scenario – as a proof of concept. Synthetic generation is easy (just pair requests with expected JSON calls), so feasibility is high. The reason this is medium priority is that it’s somewhat orthogonal to pure NLP tasks; it tests integration capability. If time permits, implementing a couple of these tasks will round out the benchmark’s coverage (since it’s one of our four core categories). They can also be expanded later with more tools or multi-step interactions.
	6.	Resume Parsing (HR Data Extraction) – Medium Priority: This task ensures the HR function is represented. It’s moderately easy to generate fake resumes, though ensuring diversity of formats might take some effort. We rank it medium because, while useful (every company’s HR can use resume screening automation), it might not cover as many verticals as the above tasks (which often apply to multiple industries). If time allows, we will include it in the initial suite. Otherwise, it’s a strong candidate for a second iteration, possibly using a mix of synthetic and sample real resumes.
	7.	Customer Feedback Sentiment/Topic Analysis – Medium Priority: This task is straightforward to create (many examples of reviews exist) and showcases the marketing/customer experience function. It’s slightly lower priority because sentiment analysis is a well-trodden task (the novelty for our benchmark would be tying it to business actionability, like extracting issue category). We will include it if resources permit, given its value for Retail and Automotive domains (e.g., analyzing product reviews or dealership feedback). It’s also an easy hook for later adding real customer feedback data from companies.
	8.	Contract Clause Extraction (Legal) – Lower Priority (Future Addition): This is an important business need (legal document analysis) but is harder to do well with synthetic data alone, as genuine legal language is nuanced. Due to time constraints, we suggest postponing this category until we can obtain sample contracts or more time to craft realistic texts. Its coverage (Legal function, impacting Finance/Insurance verticals through things like policy documents or supplier contracts) is unique, so we do aim to add it in a later phase. For now, we note it as an expansion point – possibly using a small curated set of actual contracts (anonymized) when available.

In summary, the initial benchmark suite would ideally include the first 5–6 tasks above (covering extraction, classification, decision, and basic tool use). These score highest on the combination of quick synthetic data creation and broad enterprise relevance. Subsequent tasks (resume parsing, feedback analysis, contract extraction) can be layered on once the core is in place or as real data sources are secured. By following this prioritization, we ensure we deliver a minimal viable benchmark in days that still captures a wide swath of business LLM use-cases, with a roadmap for enriching it further.

Mapping of Tasks to Business Functions and Verticals

To verify comprehensive coverage, we map the proposed evaluation tasks to the relevant horizontal functions and industry verticals they address. This illustrates how each task contributes to testing LLM performance in different business contexts:

Evaluation Task	Horizontal Function(s)	Sample Vertical Use-Case Coverage
Invoice/Receipt Extraction	Finance, Operations (Procurement)	Retail: supplier invoices; Manufacturing/Automotive: parts procurement invoices; Insurance: vendor bills; Financial Svcs: expense receipts.
Support Ticket Classification	Operations (IT Support/Customer Service)	Tech/IT (All): internal helpdesk tickets; Retail: customer service emails; Automotive: customer maintenance inquiries; Insurance: IT support tickets.
Insurance Claim Processing	Operations/Risk Management	Insurance: auto/home claim triage; Automotive: warranty claims processing; Financial Svcs: insurance in banking (credit card insurance claims).
Loan Application Decision	Finance (Lending)	Financial Services: personal loan or mortgage underwriting; Insurance: policy approval (similar decision logic); Retail Auto: auto loan financing decisions.
Resume Parsing (HR Extraction)	Human Resources	All Verticals: hiring pipeline for any company (automotive manufacturers, retail chains, banks all process resumes).
Customer Feedback Analysis	Marketing, Customer Experience	Retail: product review sentiment; Automotive: service feedback categorization; Insurance: customer complaint analysis; Financial Svcs: client survey responses.
Order Fulfillment Next-Step	Operations/Supply Chain	Retail: online order shipment vs backorder; Manufacturing: production order scheduling; Automotive: spare parts order handling.
Calendar/Tool Use (Agentic)	Operations/Executive Support	All Verticals: meeting scheduling and data retrieval (common administrative tasks in any industry); Finance: financial data API calls; HR: employee data lookup.
Contract Clause Extraction	Legal/Compliance	Financial Services: loan agreements; Insurance: policy documents; Manufacturing: supplier contracts; Automotive: dealer agreements.

(Table: Each evaluation task in the benchmark and the business areas it covers.)

As shown above, the chosen tasks collectively touch on every listed horizontal function and target vertical:
	•	HR is covered by resume parsing (and indirectly by email routing tasks).
	•	Legal is planned via contract analysis.
	•	Finance is addressed through invoice extraction and loan decisions.
	•	Marketing is covered by feedback sentiment analysis.
	•	Operations is heavily covered through support tickets, order fulfillment, and process next-step tasks.

For verticals, Insurance gets dedicated tasks (claims), Financial Services via loans (and cross-cutting finance tasks), Retail/Manufacturing via invoices, orders, and customer service, and Automotive via overlapping areas (procurement invoices, customer feedback, and insurance auto-claims). This mapping ensures the benchmark isn’t biased to any one industry – it provides a horizontal foundation with vertical-specific flavors.

Conclusion

In designing this business-centric LLM benchmark, we focus on practical, automatable tasks that mirror real-world enterprise challenges. The evaluation suite is categorized into information extraction, decision classification, straightforward classification, and tool use – covering the spectrum of what businesses need from AI, from reading documents to making process decisions to invoking actions. We have prioritized tasks that can be quickly realized with synthetic yet realistic data, and which offer maximal coverage of common business functions and key industries. Not only will this minimal benchmark provide an immediate gauge of LLM performance on business use-cases, but it also lays a groundwork that can be enriched with actual company data (in a secure, anonymized way) to increase authenticity over time.

By avoiding purely academic tasks and instead including cases like loan underwriting, invoice processing, insurance claim triage, etc., the benchmark will produce meaningful insights for enterprise AI deployments. Early efforts like the Moveworks Enterprise Benchmark and BPM-specific evaluations reinforce the need for this tailored approach ￼ ￼. Our proposed suite embraces that direction, ensuring that as organizations evaluate LLMs, they do so on the tasks that truly matter for business value and process efficiency – all within a few days’ setup. Each task’s structured JSON output and clear success criteria will make benchmark results actionable, highlighting where a model excels or falls short in handling the documents, decisions, and duties of modern business.
