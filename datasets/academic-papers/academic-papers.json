    "abstract": "This paper presents novel approaches to adapting transformer-based language models for specialized domains such as legal, medical, and financial text processing. We introduce a new technique called Domain-Specific Pretraining Refinement (DSPR) that significantly improves performance on domain-specific tasks while requiring fewer labeled examples. Our method combines contrastive learning with adaptive knowledge distillation to efficiently transfer knowledge from general-purpose language models to specialized domains. Experiments across five domains show that DSPR outperforms existing fine-tuning approaches by an average of 8.7% on domain-specific benchmarks while reducing the required training data by up to 60%. We also present a comprehensive analysis of cross-domain transfer learning capabilities and demonstrate that models trained with our approach retain more general knowledge while acquiring domain expertise."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has emerged as a promising technology for accelerating drug discovery processes, potentially addressing computational bottlenecks in molecular modeling, protein folding prediction, and virtual screening. This review examines the current state of quantum computing applications in pharmaceutical research, highlighting recent advances in quantum algorithms for molecular simulations and their experimental implementations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We discuss quantum approaches to three critical challenges in drug discovery: molecular property prediction, protein-ligand interaction modeling, and de novo drug design. Case studies of successful industry-academic collaborations demonstrate modest but promising improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy compared to classical methods. We also analyze the technical limitations of current quantum hardware and the theoretical advances needed to achieve practical quantum advantage in drug discovery."

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 157 studies published between 2010 and 2024 that project climate change impacts on crop yields across different regions, climate scenarios, and adaptation strategies. Our analysis reveals that without adaptation measures, global crop yields are projected to decline by an average of 4.2% per decade under moderate warming scenarios (RCP 4.5) and 7.8% per decade under high-emission scenarios (RCP 8.5). Regional disparities are substantial, with tropical regions facing yield reductions up to three times greater than temperate regions. Adaptation strategies, including changes in planting dates, crop varieties, and irrigation practices, can offset 35-60% of projected yield losses, but their effectiveness varies significantly by region and crop type. Economic analyses indicate that climate-induced yield changes could increase global food prices by 7-18% by 2050, with disproportionate impacts on food security in low-income countries. Our findings highlight the urgent need for targeted adaptation investments and emphasize that the effectiveness of adaptation measures diminishes under high-warming scenarios."
